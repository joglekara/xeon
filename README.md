## XEON: A matriX-based dispErsion relAtion solver for plasma physics

XEON is a collection of matrix-based plasma dispersion relation (DR) solvers written in Python 3.

- The algorithms are extended from [[1]] and [[2]].
- The linearized fluid or Vlasov equations are transformed into a matrix form, and complex frequencies `[w1, w2, w3, ...]` are computed as eigenvalues of this coefficient matrix for each wavenumber `k`.
  - The transformation of the Vlasov equations relies on the fact that the Z function of a bi-Maxwellian distribution can be written as a J-pole expansion (Pad√© approximation).
- In this matrix-based method, no initial guess is necessary, and all solutions, including eigenvectors, are captured.

### Dependencies
- Modern [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [scipy](https://www.scipy.org) are required for computation.
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is required for using the visualization tool.

### Installation
Currently, the package is in development stage and is provided only as is. One option to use the package is to make Python aware of its path:
```python
import sys
sys.path.append("/path/to/xeon/")
import xeon
```
PyPI and Anaconda distributions will be used starting release 0.2.0.
