- These markdown files (.md) display both Python codes to compute/visualize dispersion relations, and the produced images.
- Please append your path to the parent folder of `xeon` before using.
  For example, if your `xeon` copy is at `/home/john/src/xeon`, modify the code from
  ```python
  sys.path.append('/path/to/xeon')
  ```
  to
  ```python
  sys.path.append('/home/john/src')
  ```
  In the future, the code will be distributed through PyPI and Anaconda for easier installation/accessing.
